# Fatal attacks seem somewhat evenly distributed amongst the top three species.

# simply describe the color rather than the actual species. Maybe the white
# shark is easier to recognize, being one of the most well-known species.

# Question 2: Are children more likely to be attacked by sharks?

# Since this DataFrame is a collection of shark attacks, we only need the
# 'age' column for this question. 

df3.loc[:,'age'].isna().mean()

# That column is 45% missing values. There don't appear to be any other columns
# containing data covariant with age. And since the measurements are arbitrary
# there are no reliable methods to impute the age of the attack victim.

# Certainly any age measureable in months, and anything 'young' or 'teen' as well.

# This removes 40 objects from the 'age' column, the remainder is now in integer.
# Now to visualize the distribution:

age_median = question2df.loc[:,'age'].value_counts().median()
question2df['age'].value_counts().sort_index().plot\
(kind='bar', xticks=range(0,80,10), xlabel='Age', ylabel='Attacks', \
title='Recorded attacks by victim age', figsize=(15,10))
plt.axvline(17.5, color='r') # line indicating the age of 18
plt.axvline(age_median, color='g') # median

# This looks like a result. The answer to question 2 would be:
# "There are numerous shark attacks where the victim was below the 
# age of 18. However, median human age in 2015 was 29.6 
# (https://ourworldindata.org/) # and most of these records are older
# than that. Are children more likely to be attacked by sharks? Hard
# to say. The data does # not appear to diverge significantly from 
# human age distribution. Also, the # dataset is biased because it 
# only records shark attacks, not 'no shark attacks.'

#####################################################################

# Question 3: Are shark attacks where sharks were provoked more or less dangerous?

# How do we measure danger? The easiest indicator is the fatality rate. That means
# we need two columns: one that indicates whether or not the attack was provoked,
# and one indicating whether or not the attack was fatal for the victim.

df3['type'].value_counts() # seems clean enough to work with
df3['was_fatal'].value_counts() 

question3df = df3.dropna(subset=['type','was_fatal']).loc[:,['type','was_fatal']]
# this removes about 10% of rows. 

# I only need to know whether an attack was provoked or not, so:

question3df.loc[question3df['type'] != 'Provoked','type'] = 'Unprovoked'

# Now to calculate the rate of fatal outcome for provoked and unprovoked:

provoked_fatal = question3df.loc[question3df['type'] == 'Provoked','was_fatal'].mean()
unprovoked_fatal = question3df.loc[question3df['type'] == 'Unprovoked','was_fatal'].mean()
print(f"Provoked attacks had a fatal outcome in {round(provoked_fatal*100,2)}% \
of recorded cases, and unprovoked attacks had a fatal outcome in {round(unprovoked_fatal*100,2)}% \
of recorded cases.")

# It seems attacks where the sharks were provoked were less dangerous.

#####################################################################

# Question 4: Are certain activities more likely to result in a shark attack?

# This is a tricky question to answer statistically. Let's take for instance
# the activity 'swimming'. From this dataset we can find out how many shark attacks
# happened while people were swimming. We cannot, however, find out if swimming
# is likely to result in a shark attack, because we don't have data on people
# who were swimming and were not attacked by sharks. As far as the dataset is
# concerned, swimming results in a shark attack in 100% of recorded cases.

# I would presume that "making a documentary about sharks" results in a higher
# risk of a shark attack, but I don't think I could find statistical evidence
# for this. I would need records of shark documentaries without shark attacks,
# and a control sample (like data on swimmers NOT attacked by sharks).

# Because I don't want to hand in this assignment with a question simply left
# blank, I will try to make an analysis based on the activities noted in the 
# shark attacks dataset.

df3.loc[:,'activity'].value_counts()[-10:]
len(df3['activity'].unique()) / len(df3['activity'])
df3['activity'].isna().mean()

question4df = df3.dropna(subset=['activity']).loc[:,['activity']]
len(question4df['activity'].unique())

# There are 1532 unique values for activity. Looks like there are several 
# values that are rather long strings. I'll reuse some code from question 1, 
# to try and bring out the gerund verbs (words that end in '-ing').

def only_activity_verb(col):
    index = col.find('ing')
    space_index = col.rfind(' ',0,index)
    if index == -1:
        return None
    elif space_index == -1:
        return col[:index+3].lower().strip(' "')
    else:
        return col[space_index+1:index+3].lower().strip(' "')

question4df.loc[:,'activity'] = question4df.transform({'activity':only_activity_verb})

len(question4df['activity'].unique()) # down to 206 unique values
len(question4df['activity']) / len(df3['activity']) # lost about 9% of rows

question4df['activity'].value_counts()[:11].plot.bar(rot=45, figsize=(15,10), xlabel='Activities',ylabel='Recorded attacks')

# The graph shows that most shark attacks happened when the victim was swimming
# or surfing. It is reasonable to assume that the total number of people
# swimming is greater than the total number of people surfing, which would make
# surfing the more dangerous activity. I have not been able to find a dataset
# of for instance how many people go swimming in Florida waters per year, so it
# is difficult to make a proper assessment of these risks.
